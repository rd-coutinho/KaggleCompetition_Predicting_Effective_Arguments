My solution in my participation in the Kaggle competition "Feedback Prize - Predicting Effective Arguments - Rate the effectiveness of argumentative writing elements from students grade 6-12". The goal of this competition is to classify argumentative elements in student writing as "effective", "adequate" or "ineffective" creating a model using data that is representative of the 6th-12th grade population in the United States. The purpose is to provide students enhanced feedback on their argumentative writing with automated guidance using machine learning.

The solution contains the first steps of the project, including the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to investigate the training set and the modelling building the architecture based on a LSTM network (Long Short-Term Memory) to capture the relationship between words in order to make better quality argumentative predictions.
